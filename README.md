<h3>Introduction</h3>
The successful execution of this project hinged on a sequence of pivotal actions, including data loading, feature selection, data partitioning, model construction, model evaluation, and data visualization. The integration of a MongoDB database played a vital role, enabling the storage, retrieval, and representation of data within the program's classes.

Flowcharts are visual representations of processes or workflows. The above flow chart can make the sequence of the application for predicting house price more undrestandable. Additionally, a Unified Model Language (UML) can describe the whole structure of the source code and present them in at a glance.

One the most important requirements in structural programming is Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Regarding to Ali, Shakur and Idris (2017) designing UMLs would be a reliable to show OOP. In UML diagrams the classes can show their relation using lines to connect them together (Figure 2). The cooperation between flow chart and UML can help to find out a general and correct overview about the construction of object oriented programming.

<h3>Building The Programme</h3>

In Python code programming, the next step is to proceed with the implementation of my classes, "Prediction" and "GUI.". Regarding to "GUI" class the following elements are included:
<div>
  <br>
</div>
<h4>Main Window</h4>
<p>The main window displays a background image of a house, enhancing the user interface. Users can interact with the GUI through this window.</p>
<div>
  <br>
</div>

<h4>Input Fields</h4>
<p>The GUI provides input fields for three attributes: square footage of living space (sqft_living), square footage of space above (sqft_above), and square footage of the basement (sqft_basement). Users can input these attributes to make house price predictions.</p>

<div>
  <br>
</div>
<h4>Buttons</h4>
<p><strong>Predict Price:</strong> This button triggers the house price prediction process based on user inputs.
<strong>View Decision Tree:</strong> Users can visualize the decision tree model used for prediction.
<strong>View Linear Regression:</strong> This button allows users to view the linear regression model used for prediction.</p>
